<hr/>

<h2>Rules </h2>
<p>Openly is  an open community of college students who are sharing their most heartfelt  thoughts with their fellow classmates. Everything you post is shared  anonymously across your school&rsquo;s community and there is no way for others to  identify you. Your .edu email serves as a key, which allows you to sail into  the Openly. Here are some guidelines to adhere to for Openly: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>We       have a zero tolerance for bullying. </li>
  <li>You       cannot post an individual's name when used in a negative context.</li>
  <li>You       cannot post personal identifiers such as phone number, email, address, or       any social media accounts. </li>
  <li>You       cannot spam/pollute the messaging feed with pointless and repetitive posts.</li>
  <li>You       cannot impersonate other members of the community. </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Privacy </h2>
<p>Here at  Openly, we believe that your privacy is our top priority and we take every  measure to ensure that your identity remains private. We built our application  on a secure backend, which lessens the possibility of any security breach. By  eliminating the use of usernames, passwords, and photos we&rsquo;re able to prevent  the likelihood that another user will identify you. The only way another user  can identify you is if you personal decide to reveal your identity. We only ask  for your .edu email and your gender in order to place you in the same category  as your classmates, as well as to let other users know if they&rsquo;re talking to a  girl or a guy. You wouldn&rsquo;t want a 14-year-old male posting crap about your  school and pretending to be a girl, would you? The information we collect  eliminates this threat entirely. </p>
